When it comes to Industry 4.0, there’s a stark divide between vision and reality. The vision: seamless connections, insights and workflows from the factory floor to product delivery and beyond. The reality: disconnected, dysfunctional processes with little integration between operational equipment, IT systems and business units.
That’s why manufacturers have to start at the foundational level to realize the lower costs, higher revenues and greater agility promised by Industry 4.0. The first step to becoming a smart, connected industrial enterprise is to unify, align and integrate the operational systems on the factory floor with IT systems, business processes and organizational models.
We’ve worked with many manufacturers to navigate the shift to Industry 4.0. In our e-book, we describe the journey they’ve taken to create smart, interconnected solutions that will enable them to compete in the next industrial era.

There’s no escaping the vast technological, societal and cultural shifts reverberating through our lives — even, or particularly, at work. From where we work (couch or cubicle), to what we wear (hoodie or suit), to the issues we face while there (human or cyborg), the office of tomorrow is already in development today.
At the Cognizant Center for the Future of Work, we’ve been covering the developments driving these changes, from the rise of robots and machine learning, to the emergence of quantum physics and the unexaggerated death of privacy.
Now, we’ve compiled a field guide that we believe represents a state of the union for the future of work. The title of our guide — From/To — represents our belief that the best way to understand the future is to take a hard look at our (quickly changing) present. Across five categories and 42 trends, we describe where we are now and where we’re going, starting with “From Hierarchy to Wirearchy” and ending with “From Diversity to Belonging.”
Why 42? Because as author Douglas Adams points out, it’s the answer to life, the universe and everything. So that surely must include work.
We invite you to peruse our From/To ebook, categorized by The Way We Work, The Tools of Work, The Aesthetics of Work, The Issues with Work and The Meaning of Work. But don’t wait too long — by the time you get to work tomorrow, things may already be on their way to the future. Learn more by visiting our Center for The Future of Work website.
Diversity and Inclusion has been a Hallmark of Cognizant since its earliest days. Fostering a feeling of belonging and value and enabling employees to be their true, authentic selves at work is a responsibility for all of Cognizant, as it leads to greater innovation and productivity as well as a deeper understanding of and engagement with clients and their needs. Part of Cognizant’s commitment to advance gender equality for women who are pursuing or progressing with careers in technology is its global Women Empowered program.
Throughout the month of October, the company celebrated its diversity and inclusion (D&I) initiatives, honored its female associates and promoted the program with a range of activities:
Cognizant announced it had reached its goal of employing 100,000 women and its plans to further grow D&I in the future. Celebrations from this important milestone, noted as “just the beginning” by CEO Brian Humphries, were held at more than 120 locations globally.
Cognizant associates around the world participated in Estee Lauder’s Tech Day of Pink, wearing pink, taking selfies and posting on social channels, to raise awareness for women battling breast cancer and promoting the benefits of annual screenings.
Cognizant Healthcare launched a public U.S.-based breast cancer screening locator, making a $0.25 donation to the American Cancer Society for every search made in the app by December 31 of this year. Further focusing on the importance of health, the company hosted a webinar with an oncologist and breast cancer survivor for its internal associates.
The month rounded out with a webinar hosted by Women Empowered that included Cognizant U.S. Foundation Executive Director Kristen Titus and SVP and Strategic Business Unit Leader for Insurance Meera Krishnamurthy, who is also a board member for the foundation. During the webinar, the two discussed the importance of work-life balance and provided insight on how to work through challenges of being a women in the technology field.
Cognizant is committed to supporting gender diversity and inclusion across the workplace, leveling the playing field for women in tech around the world. “Businesses need to ensure that diversity is put into active practice through a culture of respect, inclusion and engagement that harnesses the richness of perspectives to create value for clients, employees and communities,” said CEO Brian Humphries.
Cognizant and Severn Trent Water (STW) recently received the Most Successful Cultural Transformation Award from the DevOps Industry Awards. The DevOps Industry Awards recognize those companies who have “accomplished significant achievements when incorporating and adopting DevOps practices.”
One of the UK’s largest water service companies, STW embarked on a digital transformation two years ago with the intent to change the company’s DNA to that of a digital native organization. The company wanted to drive cultural transformation to enable their organization to take advantage of Agile and DevOps ways of working. The company faced the challenge of not only streamlining more than 350 applications but also working within the constraints set by the water regulatory agency in the UK.
Working with Cognizant Digital Engineering, STW introduced an all-inclusive change management program that addressed the cultural shifts needed to best facilitate the technology department’s transformation. By undergoing a series of assessments, Cognizant was able to identify the areas where cultures were most vulnerable to change, and concentrated their efforts there, identifying six value streams to serve as the mechanism to deliver continuous value to the customer.
Through their work, Digital Engineering team has:
Moved from three-month software release cycles to four-week windows, saving approximately 3,900 hours in infrastructure provisioning, building and testing.
Improved lead time for starting new projects by 75%.
Increased Right-First-Time statistics by 40%.
In addition, anonymous survey results show that 85% of the team now believes they are empowered, 90% feel they belong and 78% feel they can empathize with other collaborating team members.
“Cultural transformation is difficult under the best of circumstances,” said Rohit Gupta, VP Europe, Cognizant. “With regulatory oversight and the need for STW to be competitive in the marketplace, we knew there was a great opportunity for a strategic customer management program. Our approach to assessing first the overall organization, identifying where improvements could be made and continually communicating about changes with all stakeholders were key to our success. We are pleased with the changes made at STW and excited that our work has been recognized by DevOps.”
Cognizant Interactive has been named one of the leading digital agencies in the United Kingdom for the second consecutive year, according to Econsultancy's Top 100 Digital Agencies 2019 report. Cognizant is ranked No. 3 in the Full Service/Marketing category and No. 5 overall by the U.K.-based independent research, training and consulting firm. London-based Zone, a customer experience agency that is part of Cognizant Interactive, is included in the submission.
Econsultancy's Top 100 Digital Agencies report is the annual listing of the U.K.'s largest digital marketing, design and build, technical and creative agencies. Agencies are ranked on their fee income from digital activities in the U.K. The subscription-based report features in-depth analysis and commentary on the state of the industry, along with information on each agency featured to help client-side professionals choose the right partner to help achieve their business goals.
"""In today’s digital economy", experience is emerging as a key brand differentiator,” said Sanjiv Gossain, Senior Vice President, Head of Cognizant Digital Business Europe. “Cognizant Interactive helps clients drive CX led transformation with personalized customer experiences helping improve customer engagement and overall satisfaction, while increasing revenue and reducing time to market for new product development.

In Chennai, London, New York and all around the globe, Cognizant associates joined in raising awareness for women battling breast cancer and promoting the benefits of annual screenings by celebrating “Tech Day of Pink” on October 10. The annual event recognizes Breast Cancer awareness month.
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and the second most common cancer overall, with more than 2 million new cases detected in 2018.  In 1992, The Estee Lauder Companies (ELC) launched its Breast Cancer Campaign, the company’s largest philanthropic initiative, geared toward breast cancer education and research.  Tech Day of Pink is an online, social media campaign that calls for people in the industry to wear pink on a dedicated day and, today, Cognizant employees are wearing pink, snapping selfies, and sharing photos across their social media channels to drive awareness of this disease.
Throughout the month, Cognizant has conducted an educational campaign for its employees, including hosting an internal webinar with an oncologist and breast cancer survivor.  In addition, the company launched a social media campaign encouraging its online followers to grab a friend and get a screening. In the U.S., Cognizant's Healthcare team introduced a publicly available app that allows users to find a breast cancer screening location near them.
We encourage all our readers to join forces with their colleagues and friends to wear pink, snap a picture, and post to social media using the hashtags #TechInPink2019 and #TimeToEndBreastCancer.

Moved from three-month software release cycles to four-week windows, saving approximately 3,900 hours in infrastructure provisioning, building and testing.
Improved lead time for starting new projects by 75%.
Increased Right-First-Time statistics by 40%.
In addition, anonymous survey results show that 85% of the team now believes they are empowered, 90% feel they belong and 78% feel they can empathize with other collaborating team members.
“Cultural transformation is difficult under the best of circumstances,” said Rohit Gupta, VP Europe, Cognizant. “With regulatory oversight and the need for STW to be competitive in the marketplace, we knew there was a great opportunity for a strategic customer management program. Our approach to assessing first the overall organization, identifying where improvements could be made and continually communicating about changes with all stakeholders were key to our success. We are pleased with the changes made at STW and excited that our work has been recognized by DevOps.”

Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) was among the key topics explored by entrepreneurs, policy-makers and business leaders – including Cognizant -- at this year’s Innovate Montana Symposium held October 14-16 in Butte, Montana.
Hosted by the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, the annual gathering brings together early-stage start-up executives with a network of resources to learn how to market and grow companies in Montana. With session tracks devoted to building company culture, employee recruitment, operational design, marketing and other business considerations, this year’s event drew approximately 200 attendees.
Representatives from Cognizant ATG’s Missoula, Montana, operation were invited as featured speakers in both mainstage and breakout sessions, sharing best practices to foster a diverse and inclusive workforce.
Holly Colbert, vice president, solution delivery and executive sponsor for Cognizant ATG’s local affinity groups, took part in a mainstage panel alongside Deano Roberts, vice president of Global Workplace at Slack entitled, “Engineering a Team for High Growth.”
Jorge Watson, executive director of sales support and solution engineering, facilitated a luncheon breakout session exploring diversity and inclusion both in community and in the workplace. The discussion included key leaders and contributors from the Native American and Women in the workplace community.
n Chennai, London, New York and all around the globe, Cognizant associates joined in raising awareness for women battling breast cancer and promoting the benefits of annual screenings by celebrating “Tech Day of Pink” on October 10. The annual event recognizes Breast Cancer awareness month.
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and the second most common cancer overall, with more than 2 million new cases detected in 2018.  In 1992, The Estee Lauder Companies (ELC) launched its Breast Cancer Campaign, the company’s largest philanthropic initiative, geared toward breast cancer education and research.  Tech Day of Pink is an online, social media campaign that calls for people in the industry to wear pink on a dedicated day and, today, Cognizant employees are wearing pink, snapping selfies, and sharing photos across their social media channels to drive awareness of this disease.
Throughout the month, Cognizant has conducted an educational campaign for its employees, including hosting an internal webinar with an oncologist and breast cancer survivor.  In addition, the company launched a social media campaign encouraging its online followers to grab a friend and get a screening. In the U.S., Cognizant's Healthcare team introduced a publicly available app that allows users to find a breast cancer screening location near them.
We encourage all our readers to join forces with their colleagues and friends to wear pink, snap a picture, and post to social media using the hashtags #TechInPink2019 and #TimeToEndBreastCancer.
Cognizant was recently recognized for its work in Customer Experience Transformation with Anglian Water Services, a major water utility company in the UK.
Anglian Water is undergoing a digital transformation with the goal of providing exceptional customer experience, driving significant operational efficiency and becoming more nimble across processes. As part of this journey, Cognizant has partnered with Anglian Water to redesign and relaunch the company’s web sites and deliver a first-of-its-kind digital platform within the industry. Through the platform, Cognizant has created self-service channels, including a mobile app and portal for customers to manage their accounts. Builders and developers can also use the portal to request Anglian Water’s services, replacing a previously paper-based process.
The solutions provided have driven substantial benefits for Anglian Water. Trust and brand recognition scores have steadily been on the rise, they’ve received several million-pounds in rewards and they are on target to realize millions of pounds in operational delivery savings in a five-year period.
For its work with Anglian Water, Cognizant’s Sureshkumar Ramakrishnan was named IT Architect of the Year during the Tech Excellence Awards gala. Maruthi Chokkanathan also received the Cloud Solution Architect of the Year Award at the Cloud Excellence Awards ceremony. The Cognizant team and Anglian Water received the bronze UK Customer Experience Award in the category of Online Customer Experience and Team of the Year – Customer Centricity.
“Cognizant is a trusted partner for Anglian Water,” said Iain Amis, Head of Developer Services Business Anglian Water. “By harnessing digital technologies, we were able to unlock millions of pounds in savings while improving our operations.  This award is a testament to the dedicated team who worked diligently to deliver a digital platform targeted at enhancing the pace and quality of the information flow between developer and utility service provider and within the organization across various teams. Coordination and collaboration between teams have.
Cognizant has been named the Global 2019 Systems Integrator Partner of the Year Award for Customer Scale by Pivotal Software, Inc., a cloud-native platform provider for building enterprise software.
The award, presented at Pivotal’s SpringOne Platform conference in Austin, Texas, recognizes Cognizant for its at-scale enterprise application transformation expertise. It also recognizes Cognizant’s investment in training its digital engineers on Pivotal Platform for developing software used by clients in industries such as banking, insurance, healthcare, and telecommunications. These clients often have vast, complex problems to solve that are further amplified by their size.
"""I’m delighted to announce that Cognizant has received the Global Systems Integrator Partner of the Year for Customer Scale award",""" said Nick Cayou", Vice President of Global Ecosystem," Pivotal Software. ""The Systems Integrator Partner of the Year for Customer Scale Award recognizes partners who have driven customer Pivotal Platform adoption."""
“Enterprises across industries are approaching digital transformation with a sense of urgency—and they can’t succeed in transforming at velocity and scale without the agility and efficiency gained through modern software engineering,” said Malcolm Frank, President, Cognizant Digital Business. “Moving to scalable cloud-native platforms can speed innovation, eliminate costs, unlock business value, and improve customer experiences.”
Human potential is boundless and precious. It’s the wellspring of innovation, creativity, reinvention, and growth. To tap into all of this generative power, those of us who lead organizations are responsible for ensuring that all people feel they belong, are valued, and can safely be their full, authentic selves at work.
I’ve been thinking about how essential diversity and inclusion and a sense of belonging are at the company I’m privileged to lead, Cognizant. I’m convinced that working effectively across identities tied to gender, culture, generation, race, and sexual orientation leads not only to greater innovation and productivity but also to deeper understanding of and engagement with our clients and their needs.
One aspect of Cognizant’s focus on diversity and inclusion is to advance gender equality for women who are pursuing or progressing within careers in technology. One of the ways we elevate the experience of work for women is through our global Women Empowered program, which is committed to developing more women leaders at all levels of our company.  And as part of this program, we have previously set a goal of employing at least 100,000 women around the world by 2020.
I’m proud to say that we’ve done so ahead of schedule and are now 100,000 women strong across 48 countries, representing more than a hundred nationalities. We view this as a milestone—not an end point.  We’re making other related strides as well by:
Strengthening our overall talent pipeline: 40% of our total new hires so far this year are women.
Advancing diversity in our leadership pipeline: More than 400 of our women associates will graduate by year end from “Propel,” our enterprise-wide women’s global leadership development program, launched in 2018.
Focusing on governance: Two women now serve on Cognizant’s Board of Directors, and half of the Cognizant U.S. Foundation’s Board of Directors is female.
Investing in women in tech: The foundation recently awarded $4.1 million to the National Center for Women & Information Technology, a non-profit community that works to increase girls’ and women’s meaningful participation in computing.
As a result, Forbes named Cognizant to its list of “America’s Best Employers for Diversity 2019” and to “Best Employers for Women 2018.”  And AVTAR, one of India’s leading talent strategy consulting firms, along with Working Mother Media, named Cognizant among the top 15 best companies for women in India.
We are also partnering with our clients. In recognition of Breast Cancer Awareness month, we are delighted to support The Estée Lauder Companies and their annual campaign to fight breast cancer by participating in the October 10 Tech Day of Pink. #TechInPink2019, #TimeToEndBreastCancer.
A commitment to diversity and inclusion and gender equality can change not only what organizations are capable of achieving but also what the world as a whole can achieve.  As the Economic and Social Council of the U.N. recently reported, “There’s simply no way that the world can achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals without also achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls.”
When I look at the diversity and inclusion progress we’ve made as a company, I’m encouraged by how far we’ve come. But I also recognize how much farther we need to go.  As such, our leadership team is determined to drive even greater diversity and inclusion throughout the company and to heighten awareness of this need across every industry.
At the recent 2019 AI Summit held in San Francisco, California, Cognizant received the coveted AIconics Award for Best Application of AI for Sales and Marketing. The company was also a finalist for the Best Innovation in Deep Learning and the Best Innovation in NLP awards, one of only two Fortune 200 companies to be included among mostly startups with niche solutions.
Recognizing pioneers in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), the AIconics awards “showcase the best and brightest people, projects and transformational innovations” from around the world. The award for Best Application of AI for Sales and Marketing highlighted a banking transformation in which Cognizant harnessed breakthrough innovations in AI and delivered feature-rich, insightful new processes for its client.
Working with a multinational financial services corporation, Cognizant developed an AI-powered platform that gave the client’s Customer Care Professionals (CCPs) the automation and intelligence needed to deliver superior (or greatly improved) customer service. The solution featured the very latest in speech-to-text AI technology with embedded analytics that quickly transcribes calls and provides CCPs with real-time recommendations and insights about the customer, cutting resolution times by 50 percent.
The dashboards provided CCPs with smart recommendations and cross-selling advice during calls, increasing upsell opportunities on additional products and services to the customer. The project alone is projected to save the client more than $1 million per month via greater call-handling efficiencies and effectiveness of their more than one million calls per month.
“Outstanding customer service is the foundation of any business, and AI-powered solutions can greatly enhance these interactions to improve customer experience, loyalty, brand reputation and also generate new revenue streams,” said Bret Greenstein, Senior Vice-President and Head of Cognizant's Digital Business AI Practice. “Cognizant is accelerating AI and digital transformations for its clients by engaging and incubating ideas and strategies that deliver creativity, innovation and scale to our clients.”
“Growth will solve a lot of evils in any company,” says Brian Humphries, CEO. “Ultimately, our ambition is to grow.”
In interviews with ET Now and CNBC-TV18, Cognizant’s CEO discussed the future of the company and his key areas of focus: employees and customers. “In the last six months, I’ve been making sure I understand customers, their pain points and their expectations of Cognizant as well as making sure I understand the talent and skills we have internally and the amount of investments needed to make growth happen.”
He also talked about pivoting some of the company’s resources to trends in the market, noting, “We need to win key battlegrounds in digital.” This includes IoT, data, cloud and digital engineering while optimizing and protecting traditional business.

“For most, Ramkumar Ramamoorthy was the external face of Cognizant, at least in India, the country where the company took birth in 1994 as a spin-off from Dun & Bradstreet.
But Ramamoorthy, 52, who steadily moved up the ladder having started his career with the Nasdaq-listed company in 1998 as programme manager with the content division to chairman and managing director Cognizant India , was much more than that. For the company’s senior leadership, Ram, as he is known to colleagues and friends, was chief communicator, marketer, strategist, knowledge officer and crisis communication man all rolled in one, a position that earned him enormous respect both within Cognizant and from the external ecosystem.”
Cognizant has won the 2019 Microsoft Global Partner of the Year Award for Data Modernization. The company was honored among a global field of top Microsoft partners for demonstrating excellence in innovation and implementation of customer solutions based on Microsoft technology.
“Succeeding in today’s digital economy requires the ability to compete and perform at peak levels and that requires the latest data insights,” said Arun Varadarajan, Cognizant Vice President and Global Head of Data. “At Cognizant, we use Microsoft Azure to help our clients create modern data foundations where they can view current performance metrics to identify opportunities and address challenges in real time. We are delighted to receive The Microsoft Partner of the Year award for Data Modernization once again. It is a testimony to our commitment to build intelligent solutions using Azure to address our clients’ complex business challenges.”
Awards were presented in several categories, with winners chosen from a set of more than 2,900 entrants from 115 countries worldwide. Cognizant was recognized for providing outstanding solutions and services in Data Modernization.
This award was presented to Cognizant for its excellence in innovation, development and implementation of a cloud-based data and analytics solution for a leading convenience store chain. Cognizant was chosen from 2,900 entrants across 114 countries.
The convenience store chain, with more than 10,000 stores in over a dozen countries, worked with Cognizant to modernize its artificial intelligence (AI) platform to improve decision making, increase operational agility and lower costs as part of its overall digital transformation. Cognizant’s AI team used its Data Modernization Method to redesign and reengineer the chain’s merchandising and planning for their AI platform using Azure.
This initiative consolidated the client’s data onto a single platform for information access across business units. Rather than pulling data from disparate systems, the client now has access to robust consolidated analytics that inform real time decision making. The client can now perform sales trends analysis along with other key business areas to generate precise actionable business insights.
The Cognizant AI Data Modernization Method provides businesses with a clear, structured way to transform how they source, interpret and consume their data. This cloud-first, AI-driven data ecosystem enables organizations to generate new business value and insight from their data and forms an agile, cost effective data and analytics foundation for future growth.
“We are pleased to recognize Cognizant as a Microsoft 2019 Global Partner of the Year for Data Modernization,” said JG Chirapurath,  General Manager, Azure Data and Artificial Intelligence, Microsoft Corp. “Cognizant’s commitment to this project helped transform their client’s business by increasing sales, reducing infrastructure costs and eliminating manual report generation.”
The Microsoft Partner of the Year Awards recognize Microsoft partners that have developed and delivered exceptional Microsoft-based solutions during the past year.

Cognizant’s Center for the Future of Work (CFoW) released its latest whitepaper: The Real Reality of Augmented Reality, looking at the way businesses view augmented reality (AR) and its role in the future.
CFoW partnered with Oxford Economics to survey 300 senior leaders about their views on the current and expected dynamics of the AR market. They also conducted a focused, half-day roundtable session in partnership with the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley to gather anecdotes and lessons learned from industry practitioners and academics looking at the business impacts and potential pitfalls of AR.
One-third of study respondents have scaled their AR initiatives into full implementations, are capturing substantial value, and are accelerating their future plans. This indicates that the AR market is ready to break from pilot-only projects and that it’s time to prepare for work, play, business processes and even entire business strategies to be altered by AR in the 2020s.
Key findings of the study include:
AR is happening fast, it’s happening now, and timing is everything.
AR is bringing massive change to a process near you.
Brand reputation and equipment utilization are two of the biggest AR benefits so far.
AR concerns – while significant – aren’t show stoppers.
Engines built for gaming will be serious drivers of AR’s future.
“Expert respondents in our study are clear-eyed about the challenges – technological, organizational and, even, consumer facing -- but are forging ahead anyway to make augmented reality real for their customers, suppliers, employees and partners,” writes Rob Brown, Vice President, CFoW. “All businesses require urgent action and assessment as to the applicability of AR – fast. Like the advent of the smartphone over a decade ago, this moment requires all of us to think differently, because with AR, the journey is the process.”
Cognizant’s Center for the Future of Work (CFoW) has released its Algorithms Over Brands: How to Reach Today’s and Tomorrow’s AI-Augmented Customer whitepaper. With algorithms being the new interface between brands and consumers, machine intelligence is expanding consumers’ intelligence quotient by giving them more ways to access information and explore more choices, making them more powerful and more difficult to predict than ever before.
To explore the new expectations and perceptions of the AI-savvy consumer–especially the changes wrought by new dynamics such as voice-based autonomous buying – the CFoW surveyed 6,500 consumers globally.
Based on the research, the Center believes traditional companies will need to overhaul their digital infrastructure for voice interfaces, restructure their go-to-consumer strategies, redefine the customer experience and recreate content to win customers in the future. Great products and services alone won’t cut it – companies have to go the extra mile.
Key findings from the research include:
Algorithms are usurping brand names in terms of consumer trust.
Voice interfaces are emerging as the new gatekeepers.
Companies are paying a huge penalty for offering a poor payment experience.
Personalized experiences are falling way short.
A lack of engaging content = disengaged customers.
“You know what your customer is looking for today, but what if you could predict what the customer is looking for tomorrow, and deliver value that they haven’t yet realized they needed?” writes Manish Bahl, Associate Vice President, CFoW, APAC. “Brands that reimagine their brand, rebuild reputation, and rethink their relevance to form deeper relationships with consumers and resonate with consumer behavior, are most likely to emerge as category leaders tomorrow.”

Recognized in the category of Driving Technology Transformation, Cognizant’s Sriraman Nagarajan, Vice President, Life Sciences, has been named to the 2019 PharmaVOICE 100 Most Inspiring People.
An annual list of leading professionals in life sciences, the PharmaVOICE 100 recognizes those who stand out for the positive impact they have on the industry. Sriram’s commitment to his clients is one of many reasons for his appearance on the list this year. With one client in particular, he was able to work with executives to make a shift from an internal focus to one on the patient. This not only brought about innovation that improved the quality of care, but also ultimately resulted in innovation focused roles being named at the client.
“I’m pleased to be a part of the PharmaVOICE 100 this year,” said Nagarajan. “The work my team and I do with our clients gives us the ability to impact patients globally. It’s an honor to be able to contribute in such a significant way.”
“This special issue, now in its 15th year, has become one of the most-anticipated publications of the year, and it is our extreme pleasure to once again showcase the men and women who are providing exemplary leadership, driving change, innovating in the clinic and the market, and fostering relationships to position the industry in the best way possible to serve the ultimate stakeholders: patients,” said Taren Grom, Editor and Cofounder of PharmaVOICE.
“Automation is not going to be easy, but a business-focused IPA strategy is rapidly becoming critical for insurers,” writes Ben Bengtson, Senior Vice President, Global Leader, Insurance Industry Markets. “Those that develop a holistic IPA approach that combines RPA with advanced cognitive technologies will be in position to cut costs now and build the kind of customer experience that will position them for growth and success in the years ahead.”
Excerpts from Best’s Review’s article:
“For insurers operating in an environment of low interest rates, market overcapacity and ever-growing competition, maintaining profitability means constantly looking for ways to drive down costs. That imperative has led many insurers to adopt robotic process automation (RPA).
By augmenting RPA with increasingly sophisticated cognitive technologies—often based on artificial intelligence (AI)—insurers can take the next step to intelligent process automation (IPA). IPA greatly expands the potential of automation, allowing insurers to automate not only mundane activities, but also more complex work and end-to-end business operations. As a result, it opens the door to using automation to not only increase internal efficiency, but to deliver a superior customer experience, which is essential to driving growth.
When automation projects are focused on customers, it is especially important that they not be done on a one-off or isolated basis. Instead, they should be part of an integrated strategy supported by both the business and the IT function, and viewed through a customer-centric lens. Otherwise, companies are likely to miss opportunities to provide the kind of customer experience that will help them increase revenues and grow.
As companies consider the automation of a process, they should keep several key practices in mind:
Analyze the process holistically.
Determine how various technologies can enhance the process.
Optimize the process before automating it.
Integrate front- and back-office processes.
Prioritize processes in alignment with business priorities.
Establish an automation center of excellence.
“Just as microscopes changed medicine, artificial intelligence is a ‘datascope’ that will give new insight to solutions previously thought unimaginable,” writes Ben Pring, Founder and Managing Director, Cognizant’s Center for the Future of Work.
Excerpts from G7 France, The Biarritz Summit publication's article:
“In 1831, Manchester Royal Infirmary in the UK used 50,000 leeches in treating the ill of the first great industrial city. Twenty years later, John Leonard Riddell, of Tulane University in New Orleans invented the first practical binocular microscope. Soon after, Manchester Royal Infirmary closed its leech aquarium.
Why? The medical microscope not only made the leech redundant but created an industry that today employs millions of people around the world, and in the process made the world a better place. In the transformation from leeches to microscopes, did Riddell destroy anyone’s job? Yes, probably. But microscopes were central to the explosive growth of healthcare that lead to the population and economic growth that made the modern world.
Today, we stand on the cusp of a transition into a new economy, in which prosperity and growth will leverage a whole new set of technologies that are set to profoundly change what we do and how we do it; central to this will be ‘the great story of our time’ – the rise of artificial intelligence.
AI is set to revolutionise just about everything we can think of, and just as Dr Riddell’s microscope opened up new vistas that improved all of our lives, our new AI tools will function as ‘datascopes’ – in medicine and every other industry – allowing us to reach new thresholds of creativity, insight and efficiency which again will improve all of our lives.”

DevOps.com: Using Gamification to Engage Your Workforce
“Integrating gaming into your organization can empower and excite employees, motivating them to overcome obstacles that might otherwise stand in the way of success and sustainable innovation,” writes Andres Angelani, Cognizant Softvision CEO.
Excerpts from DevOps.com’s article:
“Staying competitive in today’s fast-moving digital economy is easier said than done. Operating in a digital environment requires a significant shift in company culture and an agile software environment that accelerates time to value. Creating a DevOps environment helps companies keep pace, but it requires a workforce that is empowered, excited and motivated.
Gamification offers a unique opportunity to continuously engage your workforce by applying game-design elements and game principles into a corporate setting, making work more fun. Companies can develop a team-oriented Pod model that incorporates gamification to improve employee engagement and productivity, enable team members to work more efficiently, accelerate the learning curve and deliver more sophisticated products to market faster.
We typically focus on the output of each pod, rewarding collective behaviors and achievements that help the pod reach higher efficiency and quality targets. Collective badges are awarded to the pod while personal and peer-to-peer badges are awarded to the pod members. Pod badges are earned as a team and are focused on the health of the project, performance of the pod, quality of delivery and alignment with client objectives. A leader board displays the badges each pod earns, their experience points and their trophies. Pod and individual recognitions are celebrated over email and across Facebook Workplace, and shared with all employees.”
Campaign, UK: A Look at Marketing Jobs of the Future
“In a world of hyper-connectivity, the CMO mandate for the next 10 years pivots on resonance: making meaning for the consumer and building brand experiences that last,” writes Euan Davis, European Leader, Center for the Future of Work. “The point for marketers is not about getting people to find a suitable product, service or brand, but getting them to stick around.”
Excerpts from Campaign’s article, reproduced with permission:
“The marketing world has changed dramatically during the past 10 years and will evolve even more in the next decade. While there are some concerns about job losses in the industry as automation takes hold, I believe that these predictions completely miss the mark. Instead we will see a wealth of jobs appear within the major macroeconomic, political, demographic, societal, cultural, business and technology trends observable today.
In fact, in a recent report we identified 21 new marketing jobs that we believe will emerge over the next 10 years and become the cornerstone of the marketing industry. These jobs will create opportunities for employment, providing work for many people who are perhaps confused or concerned by the impact of the rapid acceleration of technology.”
Axios, U.S.: Tech Job Listings Have Slowed
"""A lot of companies have been on a hiring tear", but now they are seasonally constrained where they get their talent from,""" said Robert Brown", vice president at Cognizant's Center for the Future of Work.
Excerpts from Axios’ article:
“While U.S. companies continue to vigorously seek new workers, growth in openings for some hard-core digitalized jobs — projected to be among the most prominent work in the future economy — have sharply slowed, according to a new report.
Quick take: The reported weakening in hiring may reflect the general U.S. economic slowdown. But, amid a 50-year low in joblessness, it also highlights the extraordinary volatility in the technology industry, the most reliably vibrant part of the U.S. economy.
What's happening:
Year-over-year growth in postings for occupations like data scientist, software engineer and computer scientist plunged to 9% last quarter, from 30% the first quarter, according to the latest Jobs of the Future index, produced by Cognizant and provided first to Axios.
The tech-heavy index, which Cognizant says attempts to track emerging jobs as the new economy unfolds, has been largely flat for two straight quarters.
Though no one knows precisely what work the new economy will require and create, Cognizant describes its index, launched last year and published quarterly at Axios, as a serious effort to puzzle out the shape of the new world. The index consists of 50 jobs that Cognizant regards as pillars of the future economy, including several proxies that the firm named itself, such as cyber calamity forecaster and master of edge computing.”
Cognizant’s Malcolm Frank to U.S. Governors: Artificial Intelligence is a Path to Job Creation
Addressing government and business leaders at the National Governors Association’s (NGA) Summer Meeting in Salt Lake City, Utah on July 25, Malcolm Frank, President of Cognizant Digital Business, spoke on how artificial intelligence will impact the job market of the future.
“It seems counter-intuitive, but AI will actually create jobs; not eliminate them,” Frank said. “Critical to success will be your ability to act upon and harness the power of AI. If you do nothing, you may be victimized, but if you’re productive, your state will become a jobs magnet.”
Frank’s remarks kicked off the main stage plenary session where he joined Steve Bullock, Montana Governor and NGA Chair, along with Jamie Merisotis, President and CEO of Lumina Foundation, to discuss the progress of the Governor’s “Good Jobs for All Americans” Initiative. Introduced by Governor Bullock in 2018, this Initiative is designed to highlight the role U.S. governors have in connecting workers with good-paying careers, both today and in the future.
Frank outlined five elements for governors to consider as they look to attract employers and stimulate job growth in their states:
Capital investments
Urban revitalization
Educational ecosystem
Digital workplace culture
Diversity
The NGA’s 2019 Summer Meeting drew more than 35 governors and over 800 other attendees, including international dignitaries, gubernatorial staff, state economic chamber representatives, and business leaders. The group seeks to identify priority issues and deal with matters of public policy and governance at the state, national, and global levels.
Inside Retail Hong Kong: A Hyper-Personalised Customer Experience Relies Not Just on Data, But Using the Right Data Effectively
With customers constantly shifting between online and physical stores, retailers have an amazing opportunity to make their purchase experience memorable when they step into the store,” writes Singaravelu Ekambaram, Global Delivery Head, Retail and Consumer Goods. “Success is within sight for retailers who know how to leverage their consumer data, and get hyper-personalised through technology-enablement, drawing consumers to their brands time and again.”
Excerpts from Inside Retail Hong Kong’s article:
“To meet the evolving demands of the consumer, retailers are stepping up their game in ways never imagined before. While the retail industry is undergoing a pivotal transformation, shifting towards digital and omnichannel operations, retailers are increasingly differentiating their offerings by delivering curated, hyper-personalised consumer experiences.
Across Asia Pacific, retailers are starting to prioritise targeting, personalisation and consumer journey management as key focus areas in their business strategy, with close to a third of all retailers prioritising hyper-personalisation behind social-media engagement and marketing. Consumers are also giving almost as much weight to a company’s personalisation capabilities as its reputation
While technology plays a key role in hyper-personalisation, using it appropriately is what makes the difference between success and failure. Even though technology creates the hyper-personalised solutions we see, it needs to be understood that capturing consumer data of the right quality is at the very core of hyper-personalisation, without which the relevance and impact of hyper-personalisation will be lost.”
FE News, UK: World Youth Skills Day is an Important Reminder for What We Should be Doing With Youth Every Day
“Whilst World Youth Skills Day comes around once a year, we need to be working with children every single day to spark creativity, critical thinking and collaboration,” says Vivek Daga, Vice President and Country Head, UK and Ireland. “These disciplines ‘pull’ kids into STEAM careers by generating interest and confidence, rather than ‘pushing’ them to maths and science.”
Excerpts from FE News’ article, reproduced with permission:
“Rising youth unemployment is one of the most significant problems facing economies and societies in today’s world. The purpose of WYSD day is to spread awareness on the importance of youth skills development. It is the responsibility of the wider STEAM industry in helping children develop the skills they need to thrive in the digital age.
Vivek Daga, Vice President and Country Head UK and Ireland, Cognizant, said:
‘World Youth Skills Day acts as a reminder that each day we need to be working with and preparing our children – amongst them are the future leaders of the world – to develop the skills needed to thrive in the technological age. Whilst of course, some of this must be done through the education system – with the UK government investing £20 million into an Institute of Coding to improve digital skills throughout the country, the wider industry that requires STEAM skills also has a major role to play.
‘To prepare younger generations for the world of work, some businesses are encouraging and supporting school-age pupils to consider how to work with data and encourage creative thinking. For example, through our Outreach STEAM programme in the UK, we have inspired close to 200 primary age children through workshops on the jobs of the future – encouraging them to understand new roles that might be created in the next decade and working with them to explore technologies that could become reality in future. Our Digital entrepreneurship lab for girls also teaches young girls practical advice on how to start and run a business.’”
The Business Times, Singapore: Ensuring No One is Left Behind by Digital Transformation
“The rules of engagement have changed,” says Jayajyoti Sengupta, Head of APAC. “Organisations know that they can thrive only if the communities within which they operate also thrive.”
Excerpts from The Business Times’ article:
“The Business Times: As Singapore races to become a Smart Nation, how does your company ensure that no one is left behind?
Jayajyoti Sengupta: Under our CSR (corporate social responsibility) programme ‘Smart Nation. Caring Nation’, we collaborate with clients, VWOs (voluntary welfare organisation) and community partners in Singapore to help scale digital in such a way that no one is left untouched by the transformative potential of digital technologies.
The Business Times: What are the new gaps that have been emerging in the digital age, and how is your firm tackling the issue?
Jayajyoti Sengupta: The digital age, while being transformational for businesses and communities, can appear daunting to many. For students, the gap is in the application of technology to solve real-world challenges. It is critical to introduce students to digital concepts in a real-life and engaging manner. For seniors and persons with disabilities (PWDs), the gap is in accessing technology and understanding it well enough to make it work for them. The ability of digital to transform the lives of seniors and PWDs is phenomenal, but it requires effort to make them conversant with today's technology.
The Business Times: How can corporates (big or small) ensure that no one is left behind in the digital age (and to help the vulnerable)?
Jayajyoti Sengupta: It is evident that the world around us is moving faster than our ability to respond to it. The confluence of disruptive technologies has made skilling at scale to unleash the full potential of technology a key, but formidable challenge.
Organisations must support this requirement both internally as well externally - internally by reskilling and upskilling their own employees to power greater innovation, and externally by driving initiatives to empower more people with the skills and knowledge required to benefit from the opportunities presented by new technologies. Making digital technologies more accessible and inclusive is the way to go.”
Missoula Current, U.S.: All-In-Missoula Program Prepares People From All Walks of Life for Careers in Tech
“We were trying to find creative ways of addressing the labor challenge,” said Amar Juluri, Associate Vice President, Integration and AIM program leader. “It’s critical for us to tap into these skills that are available to us as a technology company.”
Excerpts from Missoula Current’s article:
“The rising stars of Missoula’s tech scene aren’t coming from the Silicon Valley or the Seattle waterfront, but from the city’s concrete crews, its downtown bars and other nontraditional sectors.
When Cognizant-ATG graduated its latest class at the University of Montana last week, it brought 28 students into its workforce, each trained in the company’s technology and business practices.
The student body represented a range of demographics, and it included Titut Yokelson, who first entered college as an exchange student from Bali in 1977.
‘At first it didn’t make sense because I’m not a technology person,’ she said. ‘But the opportunity was amazing and it was very difficult for me – the training. But I did it, and I think with my knowledge, I’m going to be in the middle of this shift that’s taking us to the future.’
The older labor force is retiring and there aren’t enough troops in the younger generation to fill their shoes. Many of today’s jobs also require new skills, something the AIM program looks to solve. It could be a model moving forward.”
BW CIO World, India: Optimizing IT Costs and Infrastructure in the Digital Age
“Much like getting oneself in shape, getting fit for the journey of digital transformation is about making a sustained effort at right-sizing and modernising legacy environments,” says R. Rajesh Balaji, Senior Vice President and Global Delivery Head of Cognizant’s Enterprise Application Services.
Excerpts from BW CIO World’s article:
“CIOs in today’s digital economy are confronted with a daunting challenge ― how to invest in new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, analytics, and robotic process automation to improve competitiveness, while simultaneously getting improved returns and performance from their legacy infrastructure.
To get their businesses on to a fitness regimen, companies must conduct a health check on their existing inventory, identifying systems that are lagging in term of performance, cost and quality, and determining their impact on enterprise workflows. Such a check-up could potentially reveal significant accumulation of technology debt resulting from:
Massive, unstructured IT applications: This is largely a mix of both legacy and modern IT infrastructure, often facing unsupported wares, redundancies, and dead code.
Heterogeneous, expensive technology architectures: These result from numerous mergers and acquisitions over the years, leading to complex architecture rules and cumbersome governance layers that are difficult to overcome.
Duplicate, legacy infrastructure: Distributed, heterogeneous networks and data centers are hard to manage and prevent an organisation from becoming truly agile.
Process inefficiencies, complex workflows: Disjointed processes and operating models impede the ability to drive efficient end-to-end workflow to deliver the best possible user/customer experience.”

MIT Sloan Review, U.S.: Cognizant’s Senior Vice President, Talent Management and Development, Says Closing the Gender Gap is Good for Business
“In closing the gender gap, your customers will benefit, your teams will benefit, and your bottom line will benefit — and it’s the right thing to do,” says Carol Cohen in an article co-written with Douglas A. Ready.
Excerpts from MIT Sloan Management Review’s article:
“Women represent more than 47% of the corporate workforce, but at the C-suite level, that number drops significantly. Ultimately, so many promising young women never reach the most influential corporate roles.
Women are entering the workforce in greater numbers than ever before. But companies aren’t doing enough to support their career development and advancement. Specifically, they aren’t providing educational and mentoring opportunities to help women ultimately progress to senior leadership and C-suite roles.
Women need champions — people who empower them to thrive — to advance their careers. But when 95% of senior leaders are male, do women truly have advocates enabling them to see a viable career path forward?
To address this, companies should:
Set a clear message and tone from the top that diversity and inclusion is a business imperative, not a corporate social responsibility program.
Commit to hiring at least at levels that reflect demography.
Pay attention to women’s career advancement needs, and put policies and practices in place to move them along.
Use data analytics and insights gleaned to help remove biases in your talent management and development decisions, ensuring hard data is used to support the benefits of gender balance in the workplace.
Measure progress and results.”
CustomerThink, U.S.: Conversational AI Can Transform Customer Engagement
“Don’t let yourself get caught off guard by thinking conversational AI is just a toy for younger generations to check the weather or play music,” writes Matt Smith, Associate Vice President, Conversational AI Practice Leader. “It isn’t. It is imperative and needs to be a priority driven from the top to ensure your organization survives the AI revolution.”
Excerpts from CustomerThink’s article:
“How companies engage with customers is quickly evolving as conversational AI moves beyond simple voice interfaces and basic chat to offer end-to-end transactional capabilities.
It’s important for c-suite leaders to know where AI technologies are being used across industries to get a sense for where to apply them in their own organizations. A structured education process will reveal the possibilities AI offers, help prevent unrealistic expectations and keep you from oversimplifying AI’s challenges.
Developing a winning AI strategy can’t be done in a vacuum. Most companies will need to rethink their organizational structure to ensure collaboration among areas that directly engage with customers or support those that do, including marketing, IT, HR, finance, supply chain, manufacturing and others. As the stewards of customer experience, marketing will be front and center in the quest to understand how customers want to interact with conversational AI.
Know your customers, and let them be your guide so you don’t end up simply replacing what they don’t like about engaging with you today with something equally frustrating. Knowing your customers and having a broad perspective of their needs and desires is critical and will help keep you from being outmaneuvered by your competition or miss opportunities to provide a better customer experience.\
B&T, Australia, Cognizant’s Director, Center for the Future of Work, Discusses the Marketing Office of the Future
“There is new work for people to do to ensure that key moments for consumers last,” writes Ben Pring. “Thanks to technology, new jobs have been created ― and will continue to be created ― to help marketing thrive in the future.”
Excerpts from B&T’s article:
“Technology is opening up a world of possibilities for CMOs and their teams, and it’s calling for new tasks and activities ― in effect, new jobs ― to be created. So what’s the new mandate for marketers to ensure that their roles are futureproofed, but still anchored in the responsibility of connecting people to stories, brands and experiences?
In a world of hyper-connectivity, the CMO mandate for the next 10 years pivots on resonance: making meaning for the consumer and building brand experiences that last. The point for marketers is not about getting people to find a suitable product, service or brand, but getting them to stick around. Capturing mindshare used to be the thing, but making it linger is the new trick.
In light of this shift, we’ve conducted in-depth research on the roles that are likely to emerge over the next decade, and become cornerstones of this new CMO mandate. Some major on technology, while others require an extra dose of empathy and emotional intelligence that only humans can provide.
These jobs are not science fiction ― they’re jobs CMOs will ask their HR departments to fill and their CFOs to fund before too long. From “Purpose Planner” to “Master Storyteller”, to “Sixth Sense Analyst” and “Object Persuasion Manager”, these highly diverse roles are also geared towards tapping into the consumer of the future at every touch point.”
PharmaVoice, U.S.: The Realities of VR and AR in the Industry
Excerpts from PharmaVoice’s article:
“Imagine you are standing in your exhibit booth on a very crowded scientific and educational meeting floor, armed with fascinating, yet difficult-to-understand medical content that needs to make its way to the many passing physicians in order to educate them on the science your company is working on. Amid the masses of other presenters, how do you catch and hold an HCP’s attention as he or she streams by?
Several pharmaceutical companies have been using augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) capabilities to provide experiential educational content.
Cognizant has been using AR technology at clinical congresses for several years, says Bryan Hill, chief technology officer, life sciences, Cognizant. One particular example involved an 80-foot artery that HCPs could access through an iPad and ‘walk’ through the experience and literally were part of the mechanism of action as they hit different hotspots and different types of experiences.
As a follow up, directly after an AR or VR experience, it is easy to capture the knowledge assessment of the HCP through a quick questionnaire, which allows reps to follow up with that HCP with targeted information on what the HCP knows or doesn’t know about the product.
Mr. Hill quotes Ben Franklin when he sums up the value of using AR or VR: ‘Tell me and I forget, teach me and I remember, involve me and I learn.’
‘When we talk about the value proposition for this set of technology, the ‘involve me and I learn’ phrase is key,’ Mr. Hill says. ‘Done well, these immersive technologies can drive understanding and retention by giving HCPs or patients the opportunity to experience science or other concepts in a very complex field.’”
PharmaVoice, U.S.: The Agile R&D Organization
Excerpts from PharmaVoice’s article:
“Agile project management, first introduced in 2001, started out as a method used in software development that challenged the traditional, linear development model. The same benefits realized by the software industry, experts say, can be realized in pharmaceutical R&D. Agile takes a more iterative development approach with small parts of projects being built and tested simultaneously.
Adaptive trials are an example of an agile approach, says Barinder Marhok, associate VP and head R&D center of excellence, life sciences, Cognizant. ‘The ability to change the protocol while the trial is still in progress was an absolutely brand new concept,’ he says. ‘Adaptive trials take a smaller proof-of-value cohort of data, which allows researchers to decide whether to continue with the current design or the current protocol requirements or refine the protocol.’
He says agile involves determining proof of value, with more iterative inputs as the project moves along. ‘I’ve worked with some pharmaceutical company partners that would not stop the investment despite high-profile trial failures because there was always a hope that the next trial would show something,’ he says. ‘This hope has been a drag on the cost of trials and the cost of developing a drug to the point where it is becoming prohibitive vis-à-vis the benefits of narrowing down the use case of a drug.’
Failing fast is part of the agile process, and he says the aim is to make adjustments quickly. ‘Companies can use a smaller cohort to determine if there are different adjusted statistical endpoints that would provide value. This allows companies to focus more of their energy on areas where a drug is showing more promise.’”
FutureIoT, Asia: Cognizant’s Global Chief Technology Officer Discusses the Benefits of Swarm Intelligence
“Swarm intelligence, applied to robotics, is an emerging field of AI inspired by the behavioural models of social insects (ants, bees, wasps),” Ann Chauhan writes. “A swarm combines the power of many minds into one, allowing the system to be smarter, more insightful, and more creative.”
Excerpts from FutureIoT’s article:
“Swarm intelligence is transforming robotics, enabling physical robots to achieve a desired collective behaviour based on inter-robot interactions as well as their interaction with the environment.
The key characteristics of the swarm include autonomy, flexibility, cooperation, scalability and decentralized control. In other words, all autonomous robots work towards a common goal; and each one of the robots is autonomous/independent, but works for all/each other. For example, a swarm of bots can be released in the bloodstream to diagnose cancer and can be reprogrammed for targeted drug delivery when anomalies are detected.
Devices that constitute a swarm are typically inexpensive and possess only some of the communication and computation capabilities needed to operate as part of a collective whole. The swarm is powered by individual bots capable of operating in a fully autonomous mode and having capabilities such as self-deployment, self-repair, and self-optimization. Operating in a swarm enables the optimal distribution of computational and storage workload, and reduces communication dependencies with base systems.”

City AM, UK: Cognizant’s European Lead, Center for the Future of Work, Says Manufacturing Work Will Change; Not Go Away
Excerpts from City AM’s article reproduced with permission:
“The future of work is at the heart of every major socio-economic-political debate. Although many are excited by the increasing impact of automation in the manufacturing industry, yesterday’s Oxford Economics report will cause others employed in industrial roles to be scared that what little grip they have on the economic ladder is about to slip away.
Looking beyond the headlines, we can see that automation is predicted to lead to productivity growth that will ensure incremental job growth. This will, however, mask huge changes in what work we do and how we do it. For example, our 21 More Jobs of the Future report predicts that roles such as flying car developer or head of machine personality design will emerge in response to new production methods. Alternatively, positions such as smart home design manager will help individuals curate their future home.
The rapid evolution of working practices has resulted in skills resembling mobile apps, requiring frequent upgrades to stay relevant. As the world of work continues to evolve based on new technologies, humans must increasingly evolve their skillsets to stay relevant and work in harmony with technologies, to ensure that their jobs are not automated away.”
Computerworld Australia: Cognizant’s Country Manager, Australia, Outlines Why the Human Touch is Essential for Developing IoT
“IoT has great potential, but its benefits can be optimised only if we are focused on developing answers for real human needs,” says Narayan Iyer. “We are building applications for people, so humans are ultimately the key to developing useful IoT applications.”
Excerpts from Computerworld Australia’s article:
“Many businesses have yet to realise the promised benefits or expected value of IoT, leading to lower than expected adoption rates and reduced ROI. This problem is particularly acute for those who are developing IoT for industrial applications (IIoT), where it needs to be scalable and where near-and-long-term ROI is imperative for promoting enterprise adoption.
At the heart of this problem lies the reality that too many IoT applications today are being designed without sufficient focus on human experiences, because of which, businesses cannot unlock the full potential of IoT. This fundamental flaw in the design is what is holding back businesses from delivering real value to customers, employees, partners, and other stakeholders. But before businesses set out on a course correction, they must first start from the roots of the application.
Successful IoT applications incorporate insights into human behaviour before building things, thereby reducing adoption risk, improving productivity, compressing development cycles, and more quickly realising the intended ROI.”
Cognizant Wins Two 2019 Artificial Intelligence Breakthrough Awards
Cognizant has received two awards – Best Overall AI-based Analytics Solution and Innovation Award for Augmented Reality -- for its innovation and success in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) from AI Breakthrough, a market intelligence organization that recognizes the top companies, technologies and products in the global AI market.
Cognizant won the “Best Overall AI-based Analytics Solution” award for its Xtreme Data Engineering (XDE) platform. The XDE platform uses evolutionary algorithms for responsive and adaptive data engineering, enabling clients to establish an operating model that continuously evolves and adapts.
The “Innovation Award for Augmented Reality” award was for Cognizant’s Microsoft-based equipment maintenance solution. The system, which harnesses augmented reality, enables clients to create digital twins (replicas) of its equipment. These twins allow technicians to interact with the replica and search through specifications while talking to an AI assistant to identify the cause of any fault in the equipment.
Combining these technologies, Cognizant recently helped one of the world’s largest pump and water management companies address the challenge of managing and maintaining its deployed devices with a limited supply of technicians. The company implemented an augmented reality solution to investigate a malfunctioning water pump. While the technician watches the IoT-connected pumps remotely, an AI-driven overlay displays repair recommendations atop the devices, which appears as a hologram. From there, expert advice is made available to non-technical staffers through an AI-driven conversational agent. Read more about the project here.
“Our team is committed to helping businesses engage and interact more effectively with their customers, with insightful, personalized user interactions that drive loyalty, revenue and growth,” said Bret Greenstein, Vice President, Cognizant Artificial Intelligence. “With our AI expertise, we are empowering businesses to drive innovation that directly impacts their business results. We are pleased to receive this recognition from AI Breakthrough and look forward to continued momentum with our clients delivering industry-leading AI-powered offerings.”
The mission of the AI Breakthrough Awards is to honor excellence and recognize the innovation, hard work and success in a range of AI and machine learning related categories, including AI platforms, deep learning, smart robotics, business intelligence, natural language processing, industry specific AI applications and many more. This year’s program attracted more than 2,500 nominations from over 15 different countries throughout the world.
“Cognizant already has a stellar reputation for providing compelling enterprise solutions for today’s most complex business issues, and their development and work in the area of AI is providing an even higher level of performance and results for their clients,” said James Johnson, managing director, AI Breakthrough. “Cognizant has delivered proven AI solutions that can accelerate decision-making, improve business processes, enhance user engagement, reduce costs and drive remarkable growth and profitability for clients.

We extend a hearty congratulations to the Cognizant AI technologies team.
CMSWire, U.S.: Cognizant Softvision CEO Discusses How to Create a Culture of Agile Innovation
Excerpts from CMSWire’s article:
“Andres Angelani, CEO of Cognizant Softvision, said maintaining an agile culture can be boiled down into four key tenets:
Fail fast, cheaply and learn as you go: It's only failure if you don't learn and take nothing away. Set objectives at the outset, and ensure the organization and stakeholders get smarter every step of the way.
Agile “theory” doesn't help: Any agile implementation needs to fit your needs, rather than prescribe processes or practices that don't make sense to your business. If speed, team autonomy, quality and business outcomes don't emerge, whoever is leading your agile transformation is under performing. Make sure you measure what matters to your business.
All about the people: acquiring, training and retaining the talent that you need to achieve the outcomes your business needs to thrive requires that you put effort in building community.
Transform while you perform: Business doesn’t stop. Today’s environment demands that we digitally transform today while we continue to perform.

Fast Company, U.S.: Cognizant-Sponsored OK Go Sandbox Announces Winners of Art in Space Contest
Excerpts from Fast Company’s article:
“The Art in Space contest marks the most ambitious effort yet from the band OK Go’s nonprofit venture, OK Go Sandbox. Sponsored by Google, Morton Salt, and Cognizant Technology Solutions, OK Go Sandbox is a partnership between the band and University of St. Thomas’s Playful Learning Lab, an organization that works with educators in the K-12 system to find unusual ways of engaging students. Sandbox’s focus—providing online resources to teach STEAM lessons using OK Go videos—is not quite as unusual as it sounds: Teachers have been showing the band’s videos in classrooms for years.
After creating web content including curriculum guides and new videos designed for classrooms, the team decided it was time to encourage young fans to build an elaborate art project on an OK Go scale. Out of that idea came Art in Space, a contest funded by Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin, with the help of Cognizant and the University of St. Thomas, which will put two student teams’ art experiments aboard Blue Origin’s New Shepard spacecraft.
Submitting to Art in Space required each team describe in detail their proposed project, necessary materials, and methodology, accompanied by illustrations. The two winning teams, which the band has just announced, hail from New York (Annie and Gracie Clark, and Alexandra Slabakis) and Utah (Blake and Kellen Hullinger and Cameron Trueblood), and are all between 11 and 16 years old.
The New York team’s submission, Dark Origin, is a kinetic art project where differently sized bits of “space debris” will rise in waves and gradually envelop a magnetized wire art sculpture. The group plans to harness anti-gravity to mix the debris and mimic the conditions of Earth’s humble beginnings.
The Utah team, on the other hand, went all in on one idea from the beginning—for space itself to write a song using cosmic radiation—and continued fine-tuning it throughout the submission process.”
Insurance Business Asia, Singapore: Cognizant’s Head of Insurance, APAC, Discusses How AI Will Change the Insurance Landscape in Asia
“The region is at the forefront of adopting newer technologies,” says Srikanth Venkatesan. “Asian insurers don’t have to deal with debilitating legacy environments, or are more willing to explore and support these technologies in view of the impact they deliver relatively quickly and at lesser costs. With the proliferation of AI-based technologies in the recent past, Asia’s insurers have started taking their first steps in that direction as well.”
Excerpts from Insurance Business Asia’s article:
“According to Venkatesan, conversational AI tools are becoming more common, with insurers harnessing these tools for improved customer engagement, assisted sales, product advisory, claims notifications, and more. He said that several new tools and use cases are also emerging in the area of more complex, algorithm-intensive solutions – such as underwriting and claims assessment, as well as fraud reduction. He pointed to several major Asian insurers, such as Prudential Singapore, Ping An, and Sompo Japan, which have enlisted machine learning (ML) for claims assessment and fraud management uses.
Venkatesan described the impact of AI in insurance as a ‘tectonic shift.’ As such, it is important that insurers are well-prepared for the shift by understanding the business impact of AI, calibrating their approach to adopt AI for the most suitable areas, and developing and executing structured plans. He offered the following pointers for insurers that want to successfully adopt AI:
Understand the technology, related impact and lessons learnt so far.
Integrate the adoption approach with enterprise strategy.
Do not compromise on data foundation.
While AI and associated technologies do have benefits, sceptics’ concerns regarding some ethical issues are not without merit. Insurers must seek to maintain the trust of their customers as well as maintain the integrity of their systems.”
Elite Business, UK: Cognizant’s Digital Partner, Media and Entertainment, Discusses Gender Bias in Voice Assistants
“Regardless of the application of AI, businesses should act proactively when it comes to considering the full end-to-end impact of any product or service,” writes David Ingham. “Companies that do not consider the ethical ramifications of their automation projects are taking a significant legal risk.”
Excerpts from Elite Business’ article:
“While AI bias is creeping into the business world, a recent UNESCO report provided more concerning findings, revealing that voice-activated assistants with female voices such as Amazon’s Alexa instil views of gender subservience. As AI increasingly enters the home as well as the workplace, any associated bias may in fact emerge as a much broader societal issue.
The first step for any organisation to address the issue of bias is to admit it exists and proactively audit its automation and AI procedures. As simple as that seems, Cognizant's, the digital solutions provider, Making AI Responsible and Effective report found that only half of businesses across the US and Europe have policies and procedures in place to identify and address ethical considerations – either in the initial design of AI applications or in their behaviour after the system is launched.
As AI becomes a mandatory strategic tool across multiple industries, the ethical considerations of intelligent systems should not just be viewed as nice to have. All companies need to be held accountable for the outcomes and impact of their products on society.”\

MarTech Advisor, U.S.: Cognizant’s Conversational AI Practice Leader Says CX Should Come Before IT
“Conversational AI is changing fast and is imperative for brand differentiation,” writes Matt Smith. “As these technologies spur new business models and market expansion, don’t be caught off guard. Marketers need a continuously evolving conversational brand strategy with customer experience at the center so they can keep up with how customers engage with conversational AI technologies and help influence overall business strategy.”
Excerpts from MarTech Advisor’s article:
“Creating a better customer experience means focusing on experience before IT. Talk to your customers through focus groups or surveys, and observe how they engage with the functions where you are considering conversational AI.
Once you’ve identified their needs, build a journey map, test different scenarios, and go back to your customers to confirm your approach. Only then is it time to evaluate technologies.
Together, marketing and IT can determine what technology to apply, which channels to use and which devices to focus on within those channels. A collaborative relationship between marketing and IT is critical to ensuring each side understands enough of the other to effectively develop successful conversational AI initiatives.
Leveraging external partners with relevant experience in design, implementation, journey mapping and building interfaces in multiple environments can accelerate your company’s ability to offer end-to-end conversational AI capabilities and increase competitive advantage.“
Australian Manufacturing News: Cognizant’s Head of Industries Business, ANZ, Says Smart Technologies Can Improve Safety in the Oil and Gas Industry
“Employee safety remains a key concern within Australia’s oil and gas sector,” writes Gaurav Sharma. “The nature of tasks and activities makes it a riskier industry than others. Workers’ fatigue is another factor increasing that risk. However, the oil and gas industry is in a prime position to take advantage of technologies such as robotics, wearables, artificial intelligence, and machine-learning to minimise some of the risks, as well as drive innovation.”
Excerpts from Australian Manufacturing News’ article:
“There is an increasing awareness across risky industries that digital technologies have an important role to play in improving work safety. Leading oil and gas providers are now looking to improve their current standards even further through data collection, monitoring, and automation.
These technologies can provide companies with better control on workplace hazards and better training, while improving onsite communications and overall workforce and business asset protection.
Machine learning can help identify patterns or equipment failures, allowing a proactive, rather than a reactive, approach to anomalies. The use of augmented reality in field training can allow workers to get familiar with new equipment or environments without taking any risks.
However, before implementing any technology, organisations should embrace proactive risk management by developing a framework based on three key milestones: identification, analysis and recommendation.”
Diginomica, U.S.: Cognizant’s Head of Strategy, Cognizant Digital Business, Shares His Optimistic View of the Future of Work
“If you want to beat the bot, you should be a better human,” says Paul Roehrig. “The idea is to double down on skills that humans do really well, that bots or silicon doesn't do really well. Things like show empathy, or curiosity. Creativity. Machines can help, but they're not going to be able to do that.”
Excerpts from Diginomica article:
“When I caught up with him, Roehrig was fresh off his first LiveWorx talk, ‘Fear Not the Bot: 21 Jobs of the Future Will Require Human Skills & Sensibilities.’ What inspired this?
‘A lot of the news, the zeitgeist, is overwhelmingly negative about the impact of technology on jobs... The whole narrative has been around destruction. But there's actually a story around productivity improvements.
So the application of AI and the application of industrial Internet of Things drives productivity up. And then there are new jobs that twenty years ago wouldn't exist - they are all based on how technology is impacting business and society,” says Roehrig.
Two views inform Roehrig's optimistic jobs outlook:
Almost all jobs will change, but they are likely to get more productive.
New jobs will emerge based on the intersection of technology, society, humans and work.
The ‘21 jobs report’ takes this forward.
One thing I like about Roehrig's optimism: it's informed by research and on-site client work. During their digital projects, Roehrig and colleagues have learned it's hard to replace an entire job with a machine; jobs are too varied and complex, loaded with barely-repeatable processes. I tend to agree with that optimistic view of the next decade or so.”
